= camel-nagios-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-nagios-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-nagios-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>

The camel-nagios sink connector supports 13 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.host* | This is the address of the Nagios host where checks should be send. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.port* | The port number of the host. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connection Timeout* | Connection timeout in millis. | 5000 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sendSync* | Whether or not to use synchronous when sending a passive check. Setting it to false will allow Camel to continue routing the message and the passive check message will be send asynchronously. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeout* | Sending timeout in millis. | 5000 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.encryption* | To specify an encryption method. One of: [NONE] [TRIPLE_DES] [XOR] [RIJNDAEL128] [RIJNDAEL192] [RIJNDAEL256] [BLOWFISH] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.password* | Password to be authenticated when sending checks to Nagios. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.nagios.lazy StartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.nagios.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.nagios.configuration* | To use a shared NagiosConfiguration | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
