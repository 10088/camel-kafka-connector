'columns_diff_exclude_unchanged_toast' instructs the connector to refresh the in-memory schema cache if there is a discrepancy between it and the schema derived from the incoming message, unless unchanged TOASTable data fully accounts for the discrepancy. This setting can improve connector performance significantly if there are frequently-updated tables that have TOASTed data that are rarely part of these updates.

| *camel.source.endpoint.snapshot SelectStatementOverrides* | This property contains a comma-separated list of fully-qualified tables (DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME) or (SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME), depending on thespecific connectors . Select statements for the individual tables are specified in further configuration properties, one for each table, identified by the id 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.DB_NAME.TABLE_NAME' or 'snapshot.select.statement.overrides.SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME', respectively. The value of those properties is the select statement to use when retrieving data from the specific table during snapshotting. A possible use case for large append-only tables is setting a specific point where to start (resume) snapshotting, in case a previous snapshotting was interrupted. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.source StructVersion* | A version of the format of the publicly visible source part in the message | "v2" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.toasted ValuePlaceholder* | Specify the constant that will be provided by Debezium to indicate that the original value is a toasted value not provided by the database.If starts with 'hex:' prefix it is expected that the rest of the string repesents hexadecimally encoded octets. | "__debezium_unavailable_value" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.source.endpoint.tombstones OnDelete* | Whether delete operations should be represented by a delete event and a subsquenttombstone event (true) or only by a delete event (false). Emitting the tombstone event (the default behavior) allows Kafka to completely delete all events pertaining to the given key once the source record got deleted. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.xmin FetchIntervalMs* | Specify how often (in ms) the xmin will be fetched from the replication slot. This xmin value is exposed by the slot which gives a lower bound of where a new replication slot could start from. The lower the value, the more likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the bigger the performance cost. The bigger the value, the less likely this value is to be the current 'true' value, but the lower the performance penalty. The default is set to 0 ms, which disables tracking xmin. | 0L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.debezium-postgres.bridge ErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.

| * camel.component.debezium-postgres.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
