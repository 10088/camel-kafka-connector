| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.name* | The name value is not used. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.appid* | APPID ID used to authenticate the user connected to the API Server | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.headerName* | To store the weather result in this header instead of the message body. This is useable if you want to keep current message body as-is. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.language* | Language of the response. One of: [en] [ru] [it] [es] [sp] [uk] [ua] [de] [pt] [ro] [pl] [fi] [nl] [fr] [bg] [sv] [se] [zh_tw] [zh] [zh_cn] [tr] [hr] [ca] | "en" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.mode* | The output format of the weather data. One of: [HTML] [JSON] [XML] | "JSON" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.period* | If null, the current weather will be returned, else use values of 5, 7, 14 days. Only the numeric value for the forecast period is actually parsed, so spelling, capitalisation of the time period is up to you (its ignored) | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.units* | The units for temperature measurement. One of: [IMPERIAL] [METRIC] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exceptionHandler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchangePattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.httpConnectionManager* | To use a custom HttpConnectionManager to manage connections | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffErrorThreshold* | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffIdleThreshold* | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoffMultiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.delay* | Milliseconds before the next poll. You can also specify time values using units, such as 60s (60 seconds), 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds), and 1h (1 hour). | 500L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.greedy* | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.initialDelay* | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. You can also specify time values using units, such as 60s (60 seconds), 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds), and 1h (1 hour). | 1000L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.repeatCount* | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.runLoggingLevel* | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. One of: [TRACE] [DEBUG] [INFO] [WARN] [ERROR] [OFF] | "TRACE" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.scheduledExecutorService* | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.lat* | Latitude of location. You can use lat and lon options instead of location. For boxed queries this is the bottom latitude. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.location* | If null Camel will try and determine your current location using the geolocation of your ip address, else specify the city,country. For well known city names, Open Weather Map will determine the best fit, but multiple results may be returned. Hence specifying and country as well will return more accurate data. If you specify current as the location then the component will try to get the current latitude and longitude and use that to get the weather details. You can use lat and lon options instead of location. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.lon* | Longitude of location. You can use lat and lon options instead of location. For boxed queries this is the left longtitude. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.component.weather.geolocationAccessKey* | The geolocation service now needs an accessKey to be used | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.weather.geolocationRequestHostIP* | The geolocation service now needs to specify the IP associated to the accessKey you're using | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.weather.bridgeErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler.
