|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.type* | Operation to perform. Consumers: NewIssues, NewComments. Producers: AddIssue, AttachFile, DeleteIssue, TransitionIssue, UpdateIssue, Watchers. See this class javadoc description for more information. One of: [ADDCOMMENT] [ADDISSUE] [ATTACH] [DELETEISSUE] [NEWISSUES] [NEWCOMMENTS] [UPDATEISSUE] [TRANSITIONISSUE] [WATCHERS] [ADDISSUELINK] [ADDWORKLOG] [FETCHISSUE] [FETCHCOMMENTS] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.delay* | Time in milliseconds to elapse for the next poll. | "6000" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.jiraUrl* | The Jira server url, example: \http://my_jira.com:8081 | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.access Token* | (OAuth only) The access token generated by the Jira server. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.consumer Key* | (OAuth only) The consumer key from Jira settings. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.password* | (Basic authentication only) The password to authenticate to the Jira server. Use only if username basic authentication is used. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.privateKey* | (OAuth only) The private key generated by the client to encrypt the conversation to the server. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.username* | (Basic authentication only) The username to authenticate to the Jira server. Use only if OAuth is not enabled on the Jira server. Do not set the username and OAuth token parameter, if they are both set, the username basic authentication takes precedence. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.verification Code* | (OAuth only) The verification code from Jira generated in the first step of the authorization proccess. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jira.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jira.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.jira.configuration* | To use a shared base jira configuration. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
