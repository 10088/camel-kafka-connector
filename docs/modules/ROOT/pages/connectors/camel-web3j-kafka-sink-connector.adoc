| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.nodeAddress* | Sets the node address used to communicate | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.addresses* | Contract address or a list of addresses. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.fromAddress* | The address the transaction is send from | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.fromBlock* | The block number, or the string latest for the last mined block or pending, earliest for not yet mined transactions. | "latest" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.fullTransactionObjects* | If true it returns the full transaction objects, if false only the hashes of the transactions. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.gasLimit* | The maximum gas allowed in this block. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.privateFor* | A transaction privateFor nodes with public keys in a Quorum network | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.quorumAPI* | If true, this will support Quorum API. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.toAddress* | The address the transaction is directed to. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.toBlock* | The block number, or the string latest for the last mined block or pending, earliest for not yet mined transactions. | "latest" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.topics* | Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be a list of topics. Specify multiple topics separated by comma. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.web3j* | The preconfigured Web3j object. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.address* | Contract address. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.atBlock* | The block number, or the string latest for the last mined block or pending, earliest for not yet mined transactions. | "latest" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.blockHash* | Hash of the block where this transaction was in. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientId* | A random hexadecimal(32 bytes) ID identifying the client. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.data* | The compiled code of a contract OR the hash of the invoked method signature and encoded parameters. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.databaseName* | The local database name. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.filterId* | The filter id to use. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.gasPrice* | Gas price used for each paid gas. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.web3j.configuration* | Default configuration | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.web3j.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started.
