= camel-websocket-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-websocket-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-websocket-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----


The camel-websocket sink connector supports 32 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.host* | The hostname. The default value is 0.0.0.0. Setting this option on the component will use the component configured value as default. | "0.0.0.0" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.port* | The port number. The default value is 9292. Setting this option on the component will use the component configured value as default. | "9292" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.resourceUri* | Name of the websocket channel to use | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maxBinary MessageSize* | Can be used to set the size in bytes that the websocket created by the websocketServlet may be accept before closing. (Default is -1 - or unlimited) | "-1" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.send Timeout* | Timeout in millis when sending to a websocket channel. The default timeout is 30000 (30 seconds). | "30000" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sendToAll* | To send to all websocket subscribers. Can be used to configure on endpoint level, instead of having to use the WebsocketConstants.SEND_TO_ALL header on the message. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.bufferSize* | Set the buffer size of the websocketServlet, which is also the max frame byte size (default 8192) | "8192" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maxIdle Time* | Set the time in ms that the websocket created by the websocketServlet may be idle before closing. (default is 300000) | "300000" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maxText MessageSize* | Can be used to set the size in characters that the websocket created by the websocketServlet may be accept before closing. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.minVersion* | Can be used to set the minimum protocol version accepted for the websocketServlet. (Default 13 - the RFC6455 version) | "13" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.allowed Origins* | The CORS allowed origins. Use to allow all. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cross OriginFilterOn* | Whether to enable CORS | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.filterPath* | Context path for filtering CORS | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.enableJmx* | If this option is true, Jetty JMX support will be enabled for this endpoint. See Jetty JMX support for more details. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sslContext Parameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.websocket.host* | The hostname. The default value is 0.0.0.0 | "0.0.0.0" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.websocket.port* | The port number. The default value is 9292 | "9292" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.websocket.socket Factory* | To configure a map which contains custom WebSocketFactory for sub protocols. The key in the map is the sub protocol. The default key is reserved for the default implementation. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.websocket.lazy StartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.websocket.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.websocket.enable Jmx* | If this option is true, Jetty JMX support will be enabled for this endpoint. See Jetty JMX support for more details. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.websocket.max Threads* | To set a value for maximum number of threads in server thread pool. MaxThreads/minThreads or threadPool fields are required due to switch to Jetty9. The default values for maxThreads is 1 2 noCores. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.websocket.min Threads* | To set a value for minimum number of threads in server thread pool. MaxThreads/minThreads or threadPool fields are required due to switch to Jetty9. The default values for minThreads is 1. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.websocket.thread Pool* | To use a custom thread pool for the server. MaxThreads/minThreads or threadPool fields are required due to switch to Jetty9. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.websocket.ssl ContextParameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.websocket.ssl KeyPassword* | The password for the keystore when using SSL. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.websocket.ssl Keystore* | The path to the keystore. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.websocket.ssl Password* | The password when using SSL. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.websocket.use GlobalSslContextParameters* | Enable usage of global SSL context parameters. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
