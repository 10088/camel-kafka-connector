// kafka-connector options: START
== camel-aws-lambda-kafka-connector source configuration

When using camel-aws-lambda-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-aws-lambda-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>

| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.function* | Name of the Lambda function. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | The operation to perform. It can be listFunctions, getFunction, createFunction, deleteFunction or invokeFunction One of: [listFunctions] [getFunction] [createAlias] [deleteAlias] [getAlias] [listAliases] [createFunction] [deleteFunction] [invokeFunction] [updateFunction] [createEventSourceMapping] [deleteEventSourceMapping] [listEventSourceMapping] [listTags] [tagResource] [untagResource] [publishVersion] [listVersions] | "invokeFunction" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.region* | Amazon AWS Region. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.awsLambdaClient* | To use a existing configured AwsLambdaClient as client | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyHost* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the Lambda client | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPort* | To define a proxy port when instantiating the Lambda client | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyProtocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the Lambda client One of: [HTTP] [HTTPS] | "HTTPS" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.accessKey* | Amazon AWS Access Key | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.secretKey* | Amazon AWS Secret Key | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-lambda.accessKey* | Amazon AWS Access Key | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-lambda.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers.

| *camel.component.aws-lambda.secretKey* | Amazon AWS Secret Key | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-lambda.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-lambda.configuration* | The AWS Lambda default configuration | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
