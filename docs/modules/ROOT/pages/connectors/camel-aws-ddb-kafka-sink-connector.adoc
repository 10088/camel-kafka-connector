= camel-aws-ddb-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-aws-ddb-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-aws-ddb-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>

The camel-aws-ddb sink connector supports 23 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.tableName* | The name of the table currently worked with. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.amazonDDB Client* | To use the AmazonDynamoDB as the client | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.consistent Read* | Determines whether or not strong consistency should be enforced when data is read. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.key AttributeName* | Attribute name when creating table | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.key AttributeType* | Attribute type when creating table | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | What operation to perform One of: [BatchGetItems] [DeleteItem] [DeleteTable] [DescribeTable] [GetItem] [PutItem] [Query] [Scan] [UpdateItem] [UpdateTable] | "PutItem" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyHost* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the DDB client | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPort* | To define a proxy port when instantiating the DDB client. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the capitalized name of the region (for example AP_EAST_1) You'll need to use the name Regions.EU_WEST_1.name() | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxy Protocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the DDB client One of: [HTTP] [HTTPS] | "HTTPS" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.read Capacity* | The provisioned throughput to reserve for reading resources from your table | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.region* | The region in which DDB client needs to work | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.write Capacity* | The provisioned throughput to reserved for writing resources to your table | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.accessKey* | Amazon AWS Access Key | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.secretKey* | Amazon AWS Secret Key | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ddb.access Key* | Amazon AWS Access Key | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ddb.lazy StartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.component.aws-ddb.secret Key* | Amazon AWS Secret Key | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws-ddb.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.aws-ddb.configuration* | The AWS DDB default configuration | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
