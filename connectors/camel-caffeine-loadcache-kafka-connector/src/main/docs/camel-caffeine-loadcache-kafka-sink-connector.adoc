= camel-caffeine-loadcache-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-caffeine-loadcache-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-caffeine-loadcache-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>

The camel-caffeine-loadcache sink connector supports 22 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.cacheName* | the cache name | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.action* | To configure the default cache action. If an action is set in the message header, then the operation from the header takes precedence. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cache* | To configure an already instantiated cache to be used | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cache Loader* | To configure a CacheLoader in case of a LoadCache use | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.create CacheIfNotExist* | Configure if a cache need to be created if it does exist or can't be pre-configured. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.eviction Type* | Set the eviction Type for this cache One of: [size_based] [time_based] | "SIZE_BASED" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.expire AfterAccessTime* | Set the expire After Access Time in case of time based Eviction (in seconds) | 300 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.expire AfterWriteTime* | Set the expire After Access Write in case of time based Eviction (in seconds) | 300 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.initial Capacity* | Set the initial Capacity for the cache | 10000 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.key* | To configure the default action key. If a key is set in the message header, then the key from the header takes precedence. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maximum Size* | Set the maximum size for the cache | 10000 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.removal Listener* | Set a specific removal Listener for the cache | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.stats Counter* | Set a specific Stats Counter for the cache stats | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.stats Enabled* | To enable stats on the cache | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyType* | The cache key type, default java.lang.Object | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.valueType* | The cache value type, default java.lang.Object | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.caffeine-loadcache.lazy StartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.caffeine-loadcache.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.caffeine-loadcache.configuration* | Sets the global component configuration | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
