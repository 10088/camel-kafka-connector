|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.uriPath* | The object information address | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.dataModule Options* | Data module options | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.protocol Options* | Protocol options | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.acknowledge Window* | Parameter W - Acknowledgment window. | 10 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.adsu AddressType* | The common ASDU address size. May be either SIZE_1 or SIZE_2. One of: [SIZE_1] [SIZE_2] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.causeOf TransmissionType* | The cause of transmission type. May be either SIZE_1 or SIZE_2. One of: [SIZE_1] [SIZE_2] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.information ObjectAddressType* | The information address size. May be either SIZE_1, SIZE_2 or SIZE_3. One of: [SIZE_1] [SIZE_2] [SIZE_3] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.max Unacknowledged* | Parameter K - Maximum number of un-acknowledged messages. | 15 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeout1* | Timeout T1 in milliseconds. | 15000 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeout2* | Timeout T2 in milliseconds. | 10000 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeout3* | Timeout T3 in milliseconds. | 20000 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cause SourceAddress* | Whether to include the source address | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connection Timeout* | Timeout in millis to wait for client to establish a connected connection. | 10000 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.ignore BackgroundScan* | Whether background scan transmissions should be ignored. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.ignore DaylightSavingTime* | Whether to ignore or respect DST | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeZone* | The timezone to use. May be any Java time zone string | "UTC" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connection Id* | An identifier grouping connection instances | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.iec60870-client.default ConnectionOptions* | Default connection options | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
