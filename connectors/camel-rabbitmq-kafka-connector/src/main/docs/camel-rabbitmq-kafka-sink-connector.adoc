When using camel-rabbitmq-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-rabbitmq-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.exchangeName* | The exchange name determines which exchange produced messages will sent to. In the case of consumers, the exchange name determines which exchange the queue will bind to. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH

| *camel.sink.endpoint.connection Factory* | To use a custom RabbitMQ connection factory. When this option is set, all connection options (connectionTimeout, requestedChannelMax...) set on URI are not used | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.deadLetter Exchange* | The name of the dead letter exchange | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.deadLetter Queue* | The name of the dead letter queue | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.deadLetter RoutingKey* | The routing key for the dead letter exchange | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.declare* | If the option is true, camel declare the exchange and queue name and bind them together. If the option is false, camel won't declare the exchange and queue name on the server. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.durable* | If we are declaring a durable exchange (the exchange will survive a server restart) | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.exchange Type* | The exchange type such as direct or topic. One of: [direct] [fanout] [headers] [topic] | "direct" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.exclusive* | Exclusive queues may only be accessed by the current connection, and are deleted when that connection closes. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.hostname* | The hostname of the running rabbitmq instance or cluster. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.passive* | Passive queues depend on the queue already to be available at RabbitMQ. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.sink.endpoint.queue* | The queue to receive messages from | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.routingKey* | The routing key to use when binding a consumer queue to the exchange. For producer routing keys, you set the header rabbitmq.ROUTING_KEY. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.skip ExchangeDeclare* | This can be used if we need to declare the queue but not the exchange | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.skipQueue Bind* | If true the queue will not be bound to the exchange after declaring it | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.skipQueue Declare* | If true the producer will not declare and bind a queue. This can be used for directing messages via an existing routing key. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.vhost* | The vhost for the channel | "/" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.allowNull Headers* | Allow pass null values to header | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

PublisherAcknowledgement will also be activated in this case. See also publisher acknowledgements - When will messages be confirmed. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

If the header is present rabbitmq.IMMEDIATE it will override this option. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
