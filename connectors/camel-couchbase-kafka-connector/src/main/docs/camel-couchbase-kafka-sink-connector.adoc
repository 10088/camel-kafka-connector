= camel-couchbase-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-couchbase-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-couchbase-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>

The camel-couchbase sink connector supports 28 options, which are listed below.

|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.protocol* | The protocol to use | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.hostname* | The hostname to use | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.port* | The port number to use | 8091 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.bucket* | The bucket to use | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.key* | The key to use | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.autoStart IdForInserts* | Define if we want an autostart Id when we are doing an insert operation | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.operation* | The operation to do | "CCB_PUT" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.persistTo* | Where to persist the data | 0 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.producer RetryAttempts* | Define the number of retry attempts | 2 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.producer RetryPause* | Define the retry pause between different attempts | 5000 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.replicate To* | Where to replicate the data | 0 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.startingId ForInsertsFrom* | Define the starting Id where we are doing an insert operation | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.additional Hosts* | The additional hosts | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.max ReconnectDelay* | Define the max delay during a reconnection | 30000L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.obsPoll Interval* | Define the observation polling interval | 400L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.obsTimeout* | Define the observation timeout | -1L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.opQueueMax BlockTime* | Define the max time an operation can be in queue blocked | 10000L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.opTimeOut* | Define the operation timeout | 2500L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.readBuffer Size* | Define the buffer size | 16384 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.should Optimize* | Define if we want to use optimization or not where possible | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeout ExceptionThreshold* | Define the threshold for throwing a timeout Exception | 998 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.password* | The password to use | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.username* | The username to use | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.couchbase.lazy StartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message).
