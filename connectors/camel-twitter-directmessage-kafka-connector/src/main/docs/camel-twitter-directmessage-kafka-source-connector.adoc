The camel-twitter-directmessage source connector supports 54 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.user* | The user name to send a direct message. This will be ignored for consumer. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridge ErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.send EmptyMessageWhenIdle* | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.type* | Endpoint type to use. One of: [polling] [direct] | "polling" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.distance Metric* | Used by the geography search, to search by radius using the configured metrics. The unit can either be mi for miles, or km for kilometers. You need to configure all the following options: longitude, latitude, radius, and distanceMetric. One of: [km] [mi] | "km" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.source.endpoint.exception Handler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use.

| *camel.source.endpoint.numberOf Pages* | The number of pages result which you want camel-twitter to consume. | "1" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sinceId* | The last tweet id which will be used for pulling the tweets. It is useful when the camel route is restarted after a long running. | 1L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.backoff Multiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again.
