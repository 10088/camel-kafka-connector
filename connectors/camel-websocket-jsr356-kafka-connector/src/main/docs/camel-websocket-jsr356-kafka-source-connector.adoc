|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.uri* | If a schemeless URI path is provided, a ServerEndpoint is deployed under that path. Else if the URI is prefixed with the 'ws://' scheme, then a connection is established to the corresponding server | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.sessionCount* | Used when the endpoint is in client mode to populate a pool of sessions | 1 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
