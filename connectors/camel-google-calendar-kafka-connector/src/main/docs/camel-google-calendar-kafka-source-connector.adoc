[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.apiName* | What kind of operation to perform One of: [ACL] [LIST] [CALENDARS] [CHANNELS] [COLORS] [FREEBUSY] [EVENTS] [SETTINGS] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.source.path.methodName* | What sub operation to use for the selected operation One of: [calendarImport] [clear] [delete] [get] [insert] [instances] [list] [move] [patch] [query] [quickAdd] [stop] [update] [watch] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.access Token* | OAuth 2 access token. This typically expires after an hour so refreshToken is recommended for long term usage. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.source.endpoint.application Name* | Google calendar application name. Example would be camel-google-calendar/1.0 | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.clientId* | Client ID of the calendar application | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.client Secret* | Client secret of the calendar application | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.email Address* | The emailAddress of the Google Service Account. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.inBody* | Sets the name of a parameter to be passed in the exchange In Body | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.p12File Name* | The name of the p12 file which has the private key to use with the Google Service Account. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.refresh Token* | OAuth 2 refresh token. Using this, the Google Calendar component can obtain a new accessToken whenever the current one expires - a necessity if the application is long-lived. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.scopes* | Specifies the level of permissions you want a calendar application to have to a user account. You can separate multiple scopes by comma. See \https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/auth for more info. | "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.user* | The email address of the user the application is trying to impersonate in the service account flow | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridge ErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.send EmptyMessageWhenIdle* | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.source.endpoint.exception Handler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.exchange Pattern* | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. One of: [InOnly] [InOut] [InOptionalOut] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.poll Strategy* | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.source.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoff ErrorThreshold* | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoff IdleThreshold* | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.backoff Multiplier* | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.delay* | Milliseconds before the next poll. You can also specify time values using units, such as 60s (60 seconds), 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds), and 1h (1 hour). | 500L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.greedy* | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.initial Delay* | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. You can also specify time values using units, such as 60s (60 seconds), 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds), and 1h (1 hour). | 1000L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.repeat Count* | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.run LoggingLevel* | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. One of: [TRACE] [DEBUG] [INFO] [WARN] [ERROR] [OFF] | "TRACE" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.source.endpoint.scheduled ExecutorService* | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.source.endpoint.scheduler* | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz component One of: [none] [spring] [quartz] | "none" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.source.endpoint.scheduler Properties* | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz, Spring based scheduler. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.start Scheduler* | Whether the scheduler should be auto started. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.timeUnit* | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options. One of: [NANOSECONDS] [MICROSECONDS] [MILLISECONDS] [SECONDS] [MINUTES] [HOURS] [DAYS] | "MILLISECONDS" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.useFixed Delay* | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.google-calendar.configuration* | To use the shared configuration | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.google-calendar.bridge ErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.google-calendar.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.google-calendar.client Factory* | To use the GoogleCalendarClientFactory as factory for creating the client. Will by default use BatchGoogleCalendarClientFactory | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
