[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.timelineType* | The timeline type to produce/consume. One of: [PUBLIC] [HOME] [USER] [MENTIONS] [RETWEETSOFME] [UNKNOWN] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.user* | The username when using timelineType=user | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.httpProxy Host* | The http proxy host which can be used for the camel-twitter. Can also be configured on the TwitterComponent level instead. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.httpProxy Password* | The http proxy password which can be used for the camel-twitter. Can also be configured on the TwitterComponent level instead. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.httpProxy Port* | The http proxy port which can be used for the camel-twitter. Can also be configured on the TwitterComponent level instead. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
