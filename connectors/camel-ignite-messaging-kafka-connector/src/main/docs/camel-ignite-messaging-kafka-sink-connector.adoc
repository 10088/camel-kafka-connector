<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-ignite-messaging-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>

[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.topic* | The topic name. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.propagate IncomingBodyIfNoReturnValue* | Sets whether to propagate the incoming body if the return type of the underlying Ignite operation is void. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.treat CollectionsAsCacheObjects* | Sets whether to treat Collections as cache objects or as Collections of items to insert/update/compute, etc. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cluster GroupExpression* | The cluster group expression. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sendMode* | The send mode to use. Possible values: UNORDERED, ORDERED. One of: [ORDERED] [UNORDERED] | "UNORDERED" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.timeout* | The timeout for the send operation when using ordered messages. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.ignite-messaging.configuration Resource* | Resource from where to load configuration. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.ignite-messaging.ignite* | Ignite instance. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.ignite-messaging.ignite Configuration* | Ignite configuration. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.ignite-messaging.lazy StartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.ignite-messaging.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
