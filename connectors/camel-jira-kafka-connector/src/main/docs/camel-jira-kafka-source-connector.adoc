| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.source.path.type* | Operation to perform. Consumers: NewIssues, NewComments. Producers: AddIssue, AttachFile, DeleteIssue, TransitionIssue, UpdateIssue, Watchers. See this class javadoc description for more information. One of: [ADDCOMMENT] [ADDISSUE] [ATTACH] [DELETEISSUE] [NEWISSUES] [NEWCOMMENTS] [UPDATEISSUE] [TRANSITIONISSUE] [WATCHERS] [ADDISSUELINK] [ADDWORKLOG] [FETCHISSUE] [FETCHCOMMENTS] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH

| *camel.source.endpoint.jiraUrl* | The Jira server url, example: \http://my_jira.com:8081 | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.source.endpoint.bridge ErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.jql* | JQL is the query language from JIRA which allows you to retrieve the data you want. For example jql=project=MyProject Where MyProject is the product key in Jira. It is important to use the RAW() and set the JQL inside it to prevent camel parsing it, example: RAW(project in (MYP, COM) AND resolution = Unresolved) | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.max Results* | Max number of issues to search for | "50" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.source.endpoint.exception Handler* | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM

| *camel.source.endpoint.private Key* | (OAuth only) The private key generated by the client to encrypt the conversation to the server. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.source.endpoint.username* | (Basic authentication only) The username to authenticate to the Jira server. Use only if OAuth is not enabled on the Jira server. Do not set the username and OAuth token parameter, if they are both set, the username basic authentication takes precedence. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.source.endpoint.verification Code* | (OAuth only) The verification code from Jira generated in the first step of the authorization proccess. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jira.bridge ErrorHandler* | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
