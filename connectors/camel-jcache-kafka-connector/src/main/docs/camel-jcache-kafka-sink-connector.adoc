= camel-jcache-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-jcache-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-jcache-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>

The camel-jcache sink connector supports 25 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.cacheName* | The name of the cache | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cache Configuration* | A Configuration for the Cache | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cache ConfigurationProperties* | The Properties for the javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider to create the CacheManager | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.caching Provider* | The fully qualified class name of the javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.configuration Uri* | An implementation specific URI for the CacheManager | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.management Enabled* | Whether management gathering is enabled | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.read Through* | If read-through caching should be used | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.statistics Enabled* | Whether statistics gathering is enabled | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.storeBy Value* | If cache should use store-by-value or store-by-reference semantics | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.write Through* | If write-through caching should be used | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.action* | To configure using a cache operation by default. If an operation in the message header, then the operation from the header takes precedence. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cache LoaderFactory* | The CacheLoader factory | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cache WriterFactory* | The CacheWriter factory | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.create CacheIfNotExists* | Configure if a cache need to be created if it does exist or can't be pre-configured. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.expiry PolicyFactory* | The ExpiryPolicy factory | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lookup Providers* | Configure if a camel-cache should try to find implementations of jcache api in runtimes like OSGi. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jcache.cache Configuration* | A Configuration for the Cache | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jcache.cache ConfigurationProperties* | Properties to configure jcache | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jcache.cache ConfigurationPropertiesRef* | References to an existing Properties or Map to lookup in the registry to use for configuring jcache. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jcache.caching Provider* | The fully qualified class name of the javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.jcache.configuration Uri* | An implementation specific URI for the CacheManager | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jcache.lazy StartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.jcache.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
