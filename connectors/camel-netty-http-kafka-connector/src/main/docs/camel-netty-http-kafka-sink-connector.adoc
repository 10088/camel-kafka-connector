The camel-netty-http sink connector supports 64 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.protocol* | The protocol to use which is either http, https or proxy - a consumer only option. One of: [http] [https] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.host* | The local hostname such as localhost, or 0.0.0.0 when being a consumer. The remote HTTP server hostname when using producer. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.port* | The host port number | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.path.path* | Resource path | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.bridgeEndpoint* | If the option is true, the producer will ignore the Exchange.HTTP_URI header, and use the endpoint's URI for request. You may also set the throwExceptionOnFailure to be false to let the producer send all the fault response back. The consumer working in the bridge mode will skip the gzip compression and WWW URL form encoding (by adding the Exchange.SKIP_GZIP_ENCODING and Exchange.SKIP_WWW_FORM_URLENCODED headers to the consumed exchange). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.disconnect* | Whether or not to disconnect(close) from Netty Channel right after use. Can be used for both consumer and producer. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keepAlive* | Setting to ensure socket is not closed due to inactivity | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.reuseAddress* | Setting to facilitate socket multiplexing | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.reuseChannel* | This option allows producers and consumers (in client mode) to reuse the same Netty Channel for the lifecycle of processing the Exchange. This is useful if you need to call a server multiple times in a Camel route and want to use the same network connection. When using this, the channel is not returned to the connection pool until the Exchange is done; or disconnected if the disconnect option is set to true. The reused Channel is stored on the Exchange as an exchange property with the key NettyConstants#NETTY_CHANNEL which allows you to obtain the channel during routing and use it as well. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sync* | Setting to set endpoint as one-way or request-response | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.tcpNoDelay* | Setting to improve TCP protocol performance | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connectTimeout* | Time to wait for a socket connection to be available. Value is in milliseconds. | 10000 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.cookieHandler* | Configure a cookie handler to maintain a HTTP session | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.requestTimeout* | Allows to use a timeout for the Netty producer when calling a remote server. By default no timeout is in use. The value is in milli seconds, so eg 30000 is 30 seconds. The requestTimeout is using Netty's ReadTimeoutHandler to trigger the timeout. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.throwExceptionOnFailure* | Option to disable throwing the HttpOperationFailedException in case of failed responses from the remote server. This allows you to get all responses regardless of the HTTP status code. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.clientInitializerFactory* | To use a custom ClientInitializerFactory | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyChannelCreation* | Channels can be lazily created to avoid exceptions, if the remote server is not up and running when the Camel producer is started. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.okStatusCodeRange* | The status codes which are considered a success response. The values are inclusive. Multiple ranges can be defined, separated by comma, e.g. 200-204,209,301-304. Each range must be a single number or from-to with the dash included. The default range is 200-299 | "200-299" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.producerPoolEnabled* | Whether producer pool is enabled or not. Important: If you turn this off then a single shared connection is used for the producer, also if you are doing request/reply. That means there is a potential issue with interleaved responses if replies comes back out-of-order. Therefore you need to have a correlation id in both the request and reply messages so you can properly correlate the replies to the Camel callback that is responsible for continue processing the message in Camel. To do this you need to implement NettyCamelStateCorrelationManager as correlation manager and configure it via the correlationManager option. See also the correlationManager option for more details. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.producerPoolMaxActive* | Sets the cap on the number of objects that can be allocated by the pool (checked out to clients, or idle awaiting checkout) at a given time. Use a negative value for no limit. | -1 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.producerPoolMaxIdle* | Sets the cap on the number of idle instances in the pool. | 100 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.producerPoolMinEvictableIdle* | Sets the minimum amount of time (value in millis) an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction by the idle object evictor. | 300000L | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.producerPoolMinIdle* | Sets the minimum number of instances allowed in the producer pool before the evictor thread (if active) spawns new objects. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.useRelativePath* | Sets whether to use a relative path in HTTP requests. | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.allowSerializedHeaders* | Only used for TCP when transferExchange is true. When set to true, serializable objects in headers and properties will be added to the exchange. Otherwise Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.channelGroup* | To use a explicit ChannelGroup. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.configuration* | To use a custom configured NettyHttpConfiguration for configuring this endpoint. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.disableStreamCache* | Determines whether or not the raw input stream from Netty HttpRequest#getContent() or HttpResponset#getContent() is cached or not (Camel will read the stream into a in light-weight memory based Stream caching) cache. By default Camel will cache the Netty input stream to support reading it multiple times to ensure it Camel can retrieve all data from the stream. However you can set this option to true when you for example need to access the raw stream, such as streaming it directly to a file or other persistent store. Mind that if you enable this option, then you cannot read the Netty stream multiple times out of the box, and you would need manually to reset the reader index on the Netty raw stream. Also Netty will auto-close the Netty stream when the Netty HTTP server/HTTP client is done processing, which means that if the asynchronous routing engine is in use then any asynchronous thread that may continue routing the org.apache.camel.Exchange may not be able to read the Netty stream, because Netty has closed it. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.headerFilterStrategy* | To use a custom org.apache.camel.spi.HeaderFilterStrategy to filter headers. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.nativeTransport* | Whether to use native transport instead of NIO. Native transport takes advantage of the host operating system and is only supported on some platforms. You need to add the netty JAR for the host operating system you are using. See more details at: \http://netty.io/wiki/native-transports.html | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.nettyHttpBinding* | To use a custom org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.NettyHttpBinding for binding to/from Netty and Camel Message API. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.options* | Allows to configure additional netty options using option. as prefix. For example option.child.keepAlive=false to set the netty option child.keepAlive=false. See the Netty documentation for possible options that can be used. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.receiveBufferSize* | The TCP/UDP buffer sizes to be used during inbound communication. Size is bytes. | 65536 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.receiveBufferSizePredictor* | Configures the buffer size predictor. See details at Jetty documentation and this mail thread. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sendBufferSize* | The TCP/UDP buffer sizes to be used during outbound communication. Size is bytes. | 65536 | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.transferException* | If enabled and an Exchange failed processing on the consumer side, and if the caused Exception was send back serialized in the response as a application/x-java-serialized-object content type. On the producer side the exception will be deserialized and thrown as is, instead of the HttpOperationFailedException. The caused exception is required to be serialized. This is by default turned off. If you enable this then be aware that Java will deserialize the incoming data from the request to Java and that can be a potential security risk. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.transferExchange* | Only used for TCP. You can transfer the exchange over the wire instead of just the body. The following fields are transferred: In body, Out body, fault body, In headers, Out headers, fault headers, exchange properties, exchange exception. This requires that the objects are serializable. Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it at WARN level. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.workerCount* | When netty works on nio mode, it uses default workerCount parameter from Netty (which is cpu_core_threads x 2). User can use this option to override the default workerCount from Netty. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.workerGroup* | To use a explicit EventLoopGroup as the boss thread pool. For example to share a thread pool with multiple consumers or producers. By default each consumer or producer has their own worker pool with 2 x cpu count core threads. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.decoders* | A list of decoders to be used. You can use a String which have values separated by comma, and have the values be looked up in the Registry. Just remember to prefix the value with # so Camel knows it should lookup. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.encoders* | A list of encoders to be used. You can use a String which have values separated by comma, and have the values be looked up in the Registry. Just remember to prefix the value with # so Camel knows it should lookup. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.enabledProtocols* | Which protocols to enable when using SSL | "TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyStoreFile* | Client side certificate keystore to be used for encryption | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyStoreFormat* | Keystore format to be used for payload encryption. Defaults to JKS if not set | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.keyStoreResource* | Client side certificate keystore to be used for encryption. Is loaded by default from classpath, but you can prefix with classpath:, file:, or http: to load the resource from different systems. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.passphrase* | Password setting to use in order to encrypt/decrypt payloads sent using SSH | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.securityProvider* | Security provider to be used for payload encryption. Defaults to SunX509 if not set. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.ssl* | Setting to specify whether SSL encryption is applied to this endpoint | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sslClientCertHeaders* | When enabled and in SSL mode, then the Netty consumer will enrich the Camel Message with headers having information about the client certificate such as subject name, issuer name, serial number, and the valid date range. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sslContextParameters* | To configure security using SSLContextParameters | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.sslHandler* | Reference to a class that could be used to return an SSL Handler | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.trustStoreFile* | Server side certificate keystore to be used for encryption | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.trustStoreResource* | Server side certificate keystore to be used for encryption. Is loaded by default from classpath, but you can prefix with classpath:, file:, or http: to load the resource from different systems. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.netty-http.configuration* | To use the NettyConfiguration as configuration when creating endpoints. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.netty-http.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.netty-http.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
