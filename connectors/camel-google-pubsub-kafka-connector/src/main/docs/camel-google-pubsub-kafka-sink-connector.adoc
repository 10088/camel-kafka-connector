| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.projectId* | Project Id | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.path.destinationName* | Destination Name | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.ackMode* | AUTO = exchange gets ack'ed/nack'ed on completion. NONE = downstream process has to ack/nack explicitly One of: [AUTO] [NONE] | "AUTO" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.concurrentConsumers* | The number of parallel streams consuming from the subscription | "1" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.connectionFactory* | ConnectionFactory to obtain connection to PubSub Service. If non provided the default one will be used | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.loggerId* | Logger ID to use when a match to the parent route required | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.maxMessagesPerPoll* | The max number of messages to receive from the server in a single API call | "1" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basicPropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-pubsub.connectionFactory* | Sets the connection factory to use: provides the ability to explicitly manage connection credentials: - the path to the key file - the Service Account Key / Email pair | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.google-pubsub.lazyStartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
