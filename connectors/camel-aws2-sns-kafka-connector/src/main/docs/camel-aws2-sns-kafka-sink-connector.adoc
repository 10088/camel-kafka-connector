|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.topicNameOrArn* | Topic name or ARN | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.amazonSNS Client* | To use the AmazonSNS as the client | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.autoCreate Topic* | Setting the autocreation of the topic | true | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.header FilterStrategy* | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to map headers to/from Camel. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.kmsMaster KeyId* | The ID of an AWS-managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.message Structure* | The message structure to use such as json | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.policy* | The policy for this queue | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyHost* | To define a proxy host when instantiating the SNS client | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxyPort* | To define a proxy port when instantiating the SNS client | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.proxy Protocol* | To define a proxy protocol when instantiating the SNS client One of: [HTTP] [HTTPS] | "HTTPS" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.queueUrl* | The queueUrl to subscribe to | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.region* | The region in which SNS client needs to work. When using this parameter, the configuration will expect the lowercase name of the region (for example ap-east-1) You'll need to use the name Region.EU_WEST_1.id() | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.serverSide EncryptionEnabled* | Define if Server Side Encryption is enabled or not on the topic | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.subject* | The subject which is used if the message header 'CamelAwsSnsSubject' is not present. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.subscribeSN StoSQS* | Define if the subscription between SNS Topic and SQS must be done or not | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.accessKey* | Amazon AWS Access Key | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.secretKey* | Amazon AWS Secret Key | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.aws2-sns.access Key* | Amazon AWS Access Key | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.component.aws2-sns.lazy StartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started.
