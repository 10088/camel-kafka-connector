= camel-atomix-map-kafka-connector sink configuration

When using camel-atomix-map-kafka-connector as sink make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for the connector:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-atomix-map-kafka-connector</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel Kafka connector version -->
</dependency>
----


The camel-atomix-map sink connector supports 24 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Priority
| *camel.sink.path.resourceName* | The distributed resource name | null | ConfigDef.Importance.HIGH
| *camel.sink.endpoint.atomix* | The Atomix instance to use | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.configuration Uri* | The Atomix configuration uri. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.default Action* | The default action. One of: [PUT] [PUT_IF_ABSENT] [GET] [CLEAR] [SIZE] [CONTAINS_KEY] [CONTAINS_VALUE] [IS_EMPTY] [ENTRY_SET] [REMOVE] [REPLACE] [VALUES] | "PUT" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.key* | The key to use if none is set in the header or to listen for events for a specific key. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.nodes* | The address of the nodes composing the cluster. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.result Header* | The header that wil carry the result. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.transport ClassName* | The class name (fqn) of the Atomix transport | "io.atomix.catalyst.transport.netty.NettyTransport" | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.ttl* | The resource ttl. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.lazyStart Producer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the endpoint should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.default ResourceConfig* | The cluster wide default resource configuration. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.default ResourceOptions* | The local default resource options. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.ephemeral* | Sets if the local member should join groups as PersistentMember or not. If set to ephemeral the local member will receive an auto generated ID thus the local one is ignored. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.read Consistency* | The read consistency level. One of: [ATOMIC] [ATOMIC_LEASE] [SEQUENTIAL] [LOCAL] | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.resource Configs* | Cluster wide resources configuration. | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| *camel.sink.endpoint.resource Options* | Local resources configurations | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.sink.endpoint.synchronous* | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.atomix-map.atomix* | The shared AtomixClient instance | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.atomix-map.configuration* | The shared component configuration | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.atomix-map.configuration Uri* | The path to the AtomixClient configuration | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.atomix-map.nodes* | The nodes the AtomixClient should connect to | null | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.atomix-map.lazy StartProducer* | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
| * camel.component.atomix-map.basic PropertyBinding* | Whether the component should use basic property binding (Camel 2.x) or the newer property binding with additional capabilities | false | ConfigDef.Importance.MEDIUM
